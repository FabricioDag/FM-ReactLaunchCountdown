## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- StackBlitz plataform
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

During the execution of a practical project, I delved into creating a custom React hook, gained insights into JavaScript date handling, and experimented extensively with responsive design within CSS inside react components. This project not only improved my understanding of React and JavaScript but also honed my problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities.

### Continued development

I encountered challenges while working with multilayer background images and i will incorporate animated card flips into the calendar whenever the timer countdowns.
